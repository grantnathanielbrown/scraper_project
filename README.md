# OBJECTIVES
The chief goal of this project is to learn more about APIs, scripting, and React. My project has two desired features - first, to allow users to view Reddit posts based on certain queries that Reddit itself does not allow users to search by. Second, to allow users to download searched content in aggregation.


# TODO
- beautify the whole page
- fix back button error
- cleanup request form
- return error message on invalid search

- autoplay (gifs) does not work on mobile
- Sort by number/type of rewards?
# What did we learn / info to remember for blog
- started with only front end, Switch to making a backend because of cors/corb and authentication

# CURRENT COMMIT
- minor css change to subReddit input, most gifs and images load properly now
